<h1>Hang's first try with layout &amp; grid</h1>

<p>This is what the page layout should look like:</p>

<div class="grid-container">
  <header class="header">Lorem Ipsum</header>
  <menu class="menu">What is LI? Why do we use LI?</menu>
  <main class="main">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
    containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
    Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</main>  
  <right class="right">Other Languages - Finnish - Swedish - English</right>
